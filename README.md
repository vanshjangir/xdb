### Additional Feature
I've implemented Range queries in O(k + logn) time rather than O(k * logn). The problem is leaf nodes, as a linked list, do not go hand-in-hand with traditional Copy-On-Write implementation. Still, I've tried to implement them anyway, and because of that, managing concurrent readers and writers has become tricky without heavy performance and efficiency downgrades, So this branch cannot go any further. Check details for this implementation [here](https://github.com/vanshjangir/xdb/blob/optimized-range-query/RANGE_Q.md).
